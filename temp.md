"❌ Bad Code:\n```javascript\nfunction sum() { return a + b; }\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n*   ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.\n*   ❌ The function lacks input parameters, making it inflexible and tightly coupled to variables in the outer scope (if `a` and `b` are defined there).\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) { return a + b; }\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n\n*   ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it reusable and self-contained.\n*   ✔ It avoids reliance on external variables, improving predictability and reducing potential side effects.\n\nFinal Note:\nAlways ensure functions have clearly defined inputs and outputs, and avoid implicit dependencies on variables outside their scope. This promotes modularity and reduces the risk of errors. 🚀\n"
